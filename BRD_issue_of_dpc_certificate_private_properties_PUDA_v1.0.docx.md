# **17\. SLAs/SLS, Escalation & Rework Rules**

## **17.1 Published SLS**

As per the service details page, overall application disposal time is 7 day(s) with stage-wise allocation:

* If overall SLS is breached: escalate to Chief Administrator/Head Office as per PUDA escalation SOP (Open Question).

## **17.4 Rework & Rejection Rules**

* Query can be raised for missing documents, invalid formats, data mismatch, or need for clarification.  
* Citizen can resubmit corrected information/documents; system maintains rework count and history.  
* If citizen does not respond within configured window, application may be auto-closed (Open Question).  
* Rejection must capture reason code and remarks; citizen can view reason on dashboard.

* Property master data availability for selected authority/scheme (UPN/property number lookup).  
* Document storage and retrieval service.  
* Notification gateway availability.  
* Digital signature/eSign setup (if output requires signing).

## **19.3 Risks**

* Mismatch between published overall SLS and sum of stage-wise allocations in input; may require reconciliation with PUDA (Open Question).  
* Physical verification dependency may cause delays if not scheduled/tracked digitally.  
* Applicants may upload incorrect/unclear documents leading to rework and SLA breaches.  
* If original documents must be submitted physically, lack of tracking may cause dispute (Open Question).

## **19.4 Assumptions**

* Citizen authentication and profile management are available as part of PUDA portal platform.  
* Role mapping (Clerk/Senior Assistant/JE/SDO/etc.) and jurisdiction assignment are configured by PUDA admin.  
* Issued output is generated in a standard PDF format and is downloadable by applicant; exact format and signing method to be confirmed.

## **19.5 Open Questions for Business Confirmation**

* Eligibility: Who can apply (owner, purchaser/transferee, authorised representative)?  
* Fee/Payment: Is any processing fee applicable for this service? If yes, fee heads and payment mode (online vs offline).  
* Property identification: Which fields are manually entered vs auto-fetched from property master? Is UPN mandatory for all authorities?  
* Physical verification: What is the checklist and what evidence is required (photos, geo-tag)? Who performs it?  
* Document formats/size limits: What are the allowed file types and maximum sizes for each document?  
* Original document submission: Are any originals required physically? How should the portal acknowledge and track it?  
* Digital signature: Which role signs the final output and what certificate standard is used?
